# Project Structure

The debugger supports subfolder of the workspace and when a c/c++ file is run via the debugger the debugger will create the following project structure:

ðŸ“¦\<Project Name><br>
â”£ ðŸ“‚Build<br>
â”£ ðŸ“‚Include<br>
â”£ ðŸ“‚Resources<br>
â”— ðŸ“‚Source<br>

The project can include the additional folder: <br>
ðŸ“‚Libs

## Folder name patterns

> Folder Type `Source Directory`  
> Regex `((?:[Ss]ource(?:s)?|[Ss]rc(?:s)?)(?!.*(?:[Ss]ource(?:s)?|[Ss]rc(?:s)?)).*)`
>
> Folder Type `Include Directory`  
> Regex `((?:[Ii]nclude(?:s)?)(?!.*(?:[Ii]nclude(?:s)?)).*)`
>
> Folder Type `Build Directory`  
> Regex `((?:[Bb]uild(?:s)?|[Bb]in(?:s)?)(?!.*(?:[Bb]uild(?:s)?|[Bb]in(?:s)?)).*)`
>
> Folder Type `Resources Directory`  
> Regex `((?:[Rr]esource(?:s)?|[Rr]es)(?!.*(?:[Rr]esource(?:s)?|[Rr]es)).*)`

---

> Optional Folder Type `Library Directory`  
> Regex `((?:[Ll]ibraries|[Ll]ib(?:rary|s)?)(?!.*(?:[Ll]ibraries|[Ll]ib(?:rary|s)?)).*)`

## Config file

You may also create a file named `config.json`:<br>
The file holds the following properties:<br>

- "**ProjectName**" - The name of the project when compiled. Defaults to the currently run file name.
- "**AdditionalIncludes**" - A list of folder directories containing header files to include in compilation process. Defaults to []
- "**AdditionalLibraries**" - A list of folder directories containing libraries to include in the compilation process. Defaults to []
- "**AdditionalDependencies**" - A list of file paths of DLL's to include in the compilation process. Defaults to []
- "**CommandLineFlags**" - A list of additional msvc options and arguments to add to the compilation process. Defaults to []
- "**ExcludeFolders**" - A list of folder names to exclude from the compilation process. Defaults to []
- "**DebugMode**" - A boolean telling to compiler to use /`MDd` Instead of /`MD`. Defaults to true

## x64/x86 Compiling

In the vscode launch settings you may specify the type of compilation from x64 or x86. Default to x64.
<br>
When compiling you may choose one of the following options:

- `Build Project` - compiles only updated file.
- `Rebuild Project` - recompiles the whole project.
- `Run Project` - runs the project without compilation.

<br>

# Additional Information:

## Settings.json

In `settings.json` you may find the following settings:

- `"SourceDirName": "Source",`
- `"BuildDirName": "Build",`
- `"IncludeDirName": "Include",`
- `"ResourceDirName": "Resources",`<br>
  These settings are the default folder names for the project when a folder is missing or not found in the project directory.

## MSVC Compiler path

In `compile_cl.bat` you may change the msvc paths found in the `LOAD_COMPILER` label.

## Project dependencies:

The following vscode extenstion are a required dependency to make the compiler work: <br>

2. `Tasks Shell Input: `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=augustocdias.tasks-shell-input
